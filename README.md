# Text Summarizer
# Overview
The Text Summarizer is a Python-based tool that implements the TextRank algorithm to generate concise summaries from longer text documents. This approach is particularly useful for distilling large volumes of information into key points, facilitating quicker understanding and analysis.

# Features
Text Preprocessing: Cleans and tokenizes input text by removing punctuation, numbers, special characters, and stopwords.
Sentence Vectorization: Utilizes GloVe word embeddings to convert sentences into numerical vectors.
Similarity Matrix Construction: Builds a matrix representing the cosine similarity between sentence vectors.
Sentence Ranking: Applies the PageRank algorithm to rank sentences based on their relevance.
Summarization: Extracts and compiles the top-ranked sentences to form a coherent summary.
